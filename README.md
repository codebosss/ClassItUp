<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

* NodeJS
* NPM
* MongoDB
* Text Editor. eg: Visual Code Studio
* CLI Tool

### Installation

1. Two APIs are being used 
- Route Mobile Api
- words API
- symbl.ai API

2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/d-realcoder/ClassItUp.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in '.env'
   ```
    Check .env.example file for format for secrets and API keys
   ```   ```



<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
### Introduction
The COVID-19 has resulted in schools shut all across the world. Globally, over 1.2 billion children are out of the classroom. As a result, education has changed dramatically, with the distinctive rise of e-learning, whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms.
Research suggests that online learning has been shown to increase retention of information, and take less time, meaning the changes coronavirus have caused might be here to stay. Therefore, we are required to accommodate and adapt to the changes we are put through. The best solution to the problems in the current scenario is digitalisation. One of the major hard hit industries during Covid-19 pandemic has been the education industry. And therefore there is a greater than ever need to provide a web application which satisfies the need of online learning. 
This invoked us to create a solution that allows students in any educational institution to get the most in-classroom experience.


### Objective: 
Our objective was to develop a web platform which makes interaction between teachers and students more efficient and smart. The platform encourages and corroborates e-learning and bridges the education gap between urban and rural students by introducing an industry level platform to enhance the way of remote teaching.
By utilising a variety of collaboration tools and engagement tactics, we built a controlled, hospitable atmosphere for students and teachers that goes beyond merely recreating a physical class/lecture through video capabilities.
This application will help schools and institutions provide a consistent experience for each student to participate and take classes as realistic as possible.



### Implementation: 
On the client side, we will be implementing ReactJs as a frontend framework assisted with TensorflowJs for generating analytics of emotions and topic wise analysis and and nivoCharts.Js for visualizing transcript data.
On Server side, NodeJs is used as a runtime environment, with Express as a framework and MongoDb Atlas as a cloud database. 
Among APIs, we have used Route Mobile API’s Whatsapp, email and sms API for communication between students and teachers, we have used Symbl.ai’ API for speech analytics and Komprehend’s NLP API for other sentence traits (such as: emotions, intent, abusive and sarcastical words) to facilitate our services.
Performance analytics is based on the combined data from the verbal as well as non-verbal transcripts.



### Technology used:
* Frontend
    * ReactJS
    * CSS
    * JavaScript
    * Material UI
* Backend
    * NodeJS
    * ExpressJS
* Database
    * MongoDB Atlas
* APIs
    * Route Mobile APIs
    * Symbl.ai
    * Words API
    * Komprehend’s NLP API

### Applications:
Following are the real world applications of our idea.
- Class can be recorded by teacher or student as and when required, which gets downloaded into the local folder and can be referenced in the future.
- Our application can also be used to get a detailed analysis of the teacher and student interaction which happens during the session and can be later used to provide the parents a better perspective of their child’s performance.
- Timely notifications are sent via email, SMS and whatsapp to both the students and the teachers so that no one misses a session and assignments.
- Teachers can view detailed report of how interactive the class is. On the basis of that they get suggestion report to make positive changes in their teaching
- Compare visual data between different classroom sessions




### Final Result: 
The outcome of our idea will be a platform where users(i.e. Students, Teachers) will be able to assess themselves or others on verbal and non-verbal aspects. A detailed analysis with user-friendly visualization will help different users in separate ways. Teachers can easily oraganize classes and students will be alerted in a timely manner

### Future Plans: 
Weekly tasks for students to upscale their skills.
Providing more features to the students regarding peer chatting. 
Detailed analysis and solution to the problems detected during assessment.
Scaling the application for a diaspora of users connected with interviews, interrogation and presentations.
Peer to peer communication and comparison among friends from friend’s list.
Adding customer support using Route Mobile Voice API.
Much More Efficient use of Route Mobile Whatsapp API
Sending suggestions to teacher and students according to classroom session via whatsapp/email/sms
